# This file allows you to ignore false positives in crypto key detection.
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.

# This file supports full glob patterns for flexible file matching.

# ===== GLOB PATTERNS =====
# Use glob patterns for powerful file matching with wildcards

# Ignore all test files anywhere in the project
**/*test*.ts             # Any TypeScript file containing "test"
**/*spec*.js             # Any JavaScript file containing "spec"
**/*.test.tsx            # Any React test files
**/*.spec.json           # Any JSON spec files

# Ignore entire directories and their contents
**/node_modules/**       # All node_modules directories
**/fixtures/**           # All fixtures directories
**/mocks/**              # All mocks directories
**/coverage/**           # All coverage directories

# Ignore specific file types
*.log                    # All log files
*.tmp                    # All temporary files
*.env*                   # All environment files (.env, .env.local, etc.)
*.map                    # All source map files

# Complex patterns
src/**/temp/**           # Temp directories anywhere under src
build/**/*.map           # All .map files in build directory
dist/**                  # Everything in dist directory

# ===== DIRECTORY PATTERNS =====
# Simple directory patterns (trailing slash optional)
tests/                   # Ignore tests directory and all contents
__tests__/               # Ignore __tests__ directory and all contents
docs/                    # Ignore documentation directory
examples/                # Ignore examples directory

# Ignore specific files by exact name
README.md                # Ignore any README.md file
package-lock.json        # Ignore package lock files
yarn.lock                # Ignore yarn lock files
LICENSE                  # Ignore license files

# ===== SPECIFIC HEX STRINGS =====
# Ignore specific 64-character hex strings that are not private keys
# Each line should contain exactly 64 hex characters
# Examples:
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef  # Example hash used in docs
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000  # Null hash
